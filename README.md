  - Token transfers and balance checks
- Transaction Management
  - Sign and execute transactions
  - Transaction status monitoring
  - Gas optimization

### Protocol Integrations
- **Cetus**: DEX operations and liquidity management
- **SuiLend**: Lending and borrowing capabilities
- **FlowX**: Trading and exchange features
- **SuiNS**: Domain name service integration
- **GoPlusLabs**: Security and analytics tools

## üíª Installation

```bash
npm install sui-agent-kit
# or
yarn add sui-agent-kit
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```typescript
import { SuiAgentKit } from 'sui-agent-kit';
import { Ed25519Keypair } from '@mysten/sui/keypairs/ed25519';

// Initialize the agent with your wallet
const wallet = new Ed25519Keypair();
const agent = new SuiAgentKit(wallet, {
  network: 'mainnet', // or 'testnet'
  config: {
    coinDeployFixedFee: 0.5, // Optional: Fixed fee for coin deployment (in SUI)
    tradeCommissionFeePercentage: 1, // Optional: Trade commission percentage
    treasury: 'YOUR_TREASURY_ADDRESS', // Optional: Treasury address for fees
  }
});
```

### Deploy a New Coin

```typescript
const tokenInfo = {
  name: "My AI Token",
  symbol: "MAT",
  decimals: 9,
  totalSupply: 1_000_000_000, // 1 billion
  fixedSupply: true,
  description: "An AI-powered token on Sui"
};

const moduleAddress = await agent.requestDeployCoin(tokenInfo);
console.log("Token deployed at:", moduleAddress);
```

### Execute Transactions

```typescript
const transaction = // ... your transaction
const txHash = await agent.signExecuteAndWaitForTransaction(transaction);
console.log("Transaction executed:", txHash);
```

## üîê Caching Configuration

The toolkit supports multiple caching strategies for optimal performance:

```typescript
const agent = new SuiAgentKit(wallet, {
  cache: {
    cacheStoreType: "redis", // "redis" | "lru" | "memory"
    externalDbUrl: "redis://localhost:6379",
    namespace: "my-cache"
  }
});
```

## ü§ñ AI Integration

Sui Agent Kit is designed to work seamlessly with AI models and frameworks:

- **LangChain Compatible**: Built-in tools and agents for LangChain integration
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time feedback for AI interactions
- **Context Management**: Efficient handling of blockchain state and AI context
- **Autonomous Operations**: Support for both guided and autonomous agent actions
